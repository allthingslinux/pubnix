# ATL Pubnix System Requirements

## Introduction

The ATL Pubnix (atl.sh) is a public access Unix system designed to serve the All Things Linux community. This system will provide shell accounts to community members, fostering education, collaboration, and hands-on learning in a traditional Unix environment. The pubnix aligns with ATL's mission to empower the Linux ecosystem through education and community support, while maintaining the non-commercial, socially-aware culture that defines the tilde/pubnix community.

The system will initially operate as a standalone service with application-based user registration, designed with future integration capabilities for ATL's planned unified authentication portal.

5. WHEN a user session is idle THEN the system SHALL automatically disconnect after a configurable timeout period

### Requirement 3: Development Environment and Tools

**User Story:** As a learning-focused user, I want access to programming languages, compilers, and development tools, so that I can practice coding and learn new technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to compile code THEN the system SHALL provide compilers for common languages (C, C++, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
2. WHEN a user wants to develop THEN the system SHALL include text editors (vim, emacs, nano) and development utilities

4. WHEN a user wants to learn scripting THEN the system SHALL include interpreters for shell, Python, Perl, and other scripting languages
5. WHEN a user needs package management THEN the system SHALL allow installation of user-space packages via appropriate package managers

### Requirement 4: Web Hosting Capabilities

**User Story:** As a creative user, I want to host simple websites and projects, so that I can share my work and learn web technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates web content THEN the system SHALL serve files from ~/public_html via HTTP
2. WHEN a user publishes content THEN the system SHALL make it accessible at atl.sh/~username
3. WHEN serving web content THEN the system SHALL support static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic CGI scripts
4. WHEN users upload files THEN the system SHALL enforce reasonable file size and type restrictions
5. IF web content violates guidelines THEN administrators SHALL have tools to disable or remove problematic content

### Requirement 5: Resource Management and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure fair resource usage and system security, so that all users have a stable and safe environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users consume resources THEN the system SHALL enforce per-user limits on disk space, CPU time, and memory usage
2. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL track resource usage and provide alerts for unusual activity
3. WHEN users run processes THEN the system SHALL limit the number of concurrent processes per user
4. WHEN detecting abuse THEN the system SHALL automatically throttle or suspend accounts exceeding resource limits
5. WHEN maintaining security THEN the system SHALL regularly update packages and apply security patches

### Requirement 6: Community Features and Communication

**User Story:** As a pubnix community member, I want tools to communicate and collaborate with other users, so that I can participate in the social aspects of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users want to communicate THEN the system SHALL provide traditional Unix communication tools (write, wall, finger, etc.)
2. WHEN users need to find others THEN the system SHALL provide user discovery commands (who, w, users)
3. WHEN users want to share information THEN the system SHALL support user-to-user messaging and bulletin systems
4. WHEN building community THEN the system SHALL include shared spaces for collaborative projects
5. WHEN users need help THEN the system SHALL provide documentation and getting-started guides

### Requirement 7: System Administration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive tools for managing users, monitoring system health, and maintaining the pubnix, so that I can ensure reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide tools for account creation, modification, and deletion
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on system usage, user activity, and resource consumption
3. WHEN maintaining the system THEN the system SHALL provide automated backup and recovery capabilities
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of system and user activities
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support migration to larger infrastructure

### Requirement 8: Future Integration Readiness

**User Story:** As an ATL infrastructure administrator, I want the pubnix system designed for future integration with unified authentication, so that users can eventually access all ATL services through a single portal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing authentication THEN the system SHALL use modular authentication backends to support future LDAP/SSO integration
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL structure user information to be compatible with centralized user management
3. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL use APIs and interfaces that can integrate with external management systems
4. WHEN planning architecture THEN the system SHALL document integration points for future portal connectivity
5. WHEN building user management THEN the system SHALL support external user provisioning and deprovisioning workflows

### Requirement 9: Infrastructure and Deployment

**User Story:** As an infrastructure administrator, I want the pubnix system deployed on reliable Hetzner Cloud infrastructure with proper networking, so that users have consistent access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL run on Debian-based Hetzner Cloud VPS with appropriate specifications
