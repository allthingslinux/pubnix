# Meta Guidelines

## Kiro
- You have access to multiple MCP servers for tool calling like ref, context7, clear-thoguht, desktop-commander, and more.
- This is a MONOREPO, please always ensure you are executing commands from their correct directories as some package managers/test suites/etc will fail if you are in the wrong root directory.
- Update/create steering documents as specs/tasks.md progress is made.

## Git:
- Use conventional commits
- Use traditional branch names e.g. feature/, fix/, refactor/, chore/, etc.
